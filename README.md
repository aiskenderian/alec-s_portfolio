[Project 1:Lead Toxicity in Turkey Vultures Research Project](https://github.com/aiskenderian/alec-s_portfolio/blob/main/Lead%20Toxicity%20Effects%20on%20Turkey%20Vulture%20Migration%20Research%20Project)

Background: Lead toxicity is a significant environmental problem that can impact many different species, including birds of prey such as the turkey vulture. In this research project, we aimed to investigate the effects of lead toxicity on the migration patterns of turkey vultures.

Objectives: Our specific objectives were to:

Assess lead exposure in turkey vultures during migration
Evaluate the impact of lead toxicity on turkey vulture migration patterns
Investigate potential sources of lead exposure during migration
Methods: We captured and tagged turkey vultures during migration and collected blood samples for lead analysis. We also used GPS tracking devices to monitor the migration patterns of the tagged vultures and conducted a field survey to identify potential sources of lead exposure during migration.

Results: Our analysis revealed that a significant proportion of the turkey vultures we tagged had elevated blood lead levels, indicating exposure to lead during migration. We found that lead toxicity was associated with changes in migration patterns, with vultures having a delayed and more erratic migration. Our field survey identified lead-based ammunition as a significant source of lead exposure during migration.

Conclusion: Our research highlights the serious threat that lead toxicity poses to turkey vulture migration and underscores the need for action to reduce sources of lead exposure during migration. Specifically, we recommend transitioning away from lead-based ammunition in hunting and shooting activities to reduce the risk of lead poisoning in turkey vultures and other wildlife.
